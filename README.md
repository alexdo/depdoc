DepDoc helps you document the dependencies of your project, currently supporting Composer and Node packages.

# Usage

## Creating and updating dependencies file

```
./vendor/bin/depdoc update
```

Creates and updates a DEPENDENCIES.md file in your repository, which contains every installed Composer and Node package, its version and description, and offers you a way to document why and how you use this package.

By adding a lock emoji (ðŸ”’) after the version number, you can document that this package should not be updated. Alternatively you can use ðŸ›‡, âš , or âœ‹.

## Validating dependencies file

```
./vendor/bin/depdoc validate
```

Validates that every installed dependency is documented in DEPENDENCIES.md. Also makes sure that no package surpasses its locked version.

Use strict modes to verify your package version matches the documented dependencies.

```
./vendor/bin/depdoc validate --strict
```
Checks for major and minor version to match, i.e. installed **1.0.1** and documented **1.0.0** will bypass validation but installed **1.1.0** and documented **1.0.0** won't.

```
./vendor/bin/depdoc validate --very-strict
```
Checks for full semantic versioning match, i.e. installed **1.0.1** and documented **1.0.0** will not bypass validation.
